### Hey there üëã

### I'm Ana Paula, but you can call me Nylla. I'm a full stack web developer student.

I know what you're thinking... "Why Nylla?"... It's a childhood nickname. My friends and I invented it to roleplay in the Harry Potter world and it kinda stuck. üòÅ

I live in Bras√≠lia, Brazil. I'm currently studying at [Trybe](http://www.trybe.com.br), a nationally renowned Programming School. I also enjoy everything related to graphic design, languages, AI and gaming.
I'm an ESL teacher and I have an Online English Course. I'm developing an application based on my teaching methodology as a way to apply everything I've been learning and also expand my business.
